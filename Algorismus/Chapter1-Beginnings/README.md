# What is an Algorithm

The study of Algorithms has sadly been tarnished by heretics who refuse to undertake a deep understanding of the scripture.

An Algorithm in its purest form is a set of rules that will **always** provide the correct output for a specified problem.

There are **3** commandments that every disciple must remember when practicing *Algorismus*.

1. **Our Constraints** - What are the limitations of our problem.

2. **Our Choices** - What are the choices we can make.

3. **Our Goal** - What is the goal of our algorithm.

Following these three commandments does **not** guarantee success.

Consistent practice, prayers, and reading of the scriptures are the only ways to guarantee success. However applying the **3** commandments ensures that we are able to calmly assess the problem in a structured manner.
