# Algospel

The one and only gospel written on algorithms.
The gospel is divided into 3 parts

   1. Chapter of *Structures*
   2. Chapter of [*Algorismus*](./Algorismus)
   3. Hymns of [*Practice*](./Hymns)

One does not need to read the gospel in order. However it is highly reccomended that if one is ignorant of *Structures* that he quickly look over it before moving on to *Algorismus* as many teachings build off the scriptures in *Structures*.
