# Holy Scriptures

There are many holy works that accompany the study of *Algorismus*. Below are resources where to find them and what they contain.

1. [*Introduction to Algorithms*](http://web.karabuk.edu.tr/hakankutucu/CME222/MIT[1].Press.Introduction.to.Algorithms.2nd.Edition.eBook-TLFeBOOK.pdf) by CLRS

This text is considered by many to be the best resouce for studying algorithms. Thebook covers many important algorithms. It's only flaw is that it is heavy in mathwhich may deter readers. Knowledge of set theory, limits, and discrete math helps but is not required.

2. [*Algorithms*](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/cs112/CourseMaterials/AlgorithmsChapterOne.pdf) by Robert Sedgewick

Another great book on Algorithms. The book is written with Java in mind, however it still provides excellent guidance. It is also somewhat heavy in math, but contains many different algorithms such as Euclid's Algorithm or Sieve's Algorithm, so it is possible to use it as an algorithm reference book.

3. [*Algorithm Design Manual*](http://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf) by Steven Skiena
    
A much more approachable book. The book focuses less on the study of Algorithms, but more on the design aspect. It helps answer: "How do we write algorithms?" The book's content does not have much math, and has more analogies making it the perfect book for readers who have an aversion for math. Note* This book is best read in conjuction with one of the above books. Although the book itself is an excellent resource, it has some gaps in knowledge regarding the fundamentals of certain algorithm design techniques (ie. Greedy Algorithms/Dynamic Programming).

4. [*The Art of Computer Programming*](http://broiler.astrometry.net/~kilian/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming%20-%20Vol%201.pdf) by Donald Knuth
    
The founding father of data structures and algorithms. Knuth wrote a 4 volume series on the art of programming. The first volume is a fundamental analysis/teaching of data structures and algorithms. The book is difficult and dated. However it's 
content often touches upon subjects that are neglected in other books that may offer additional insight.
